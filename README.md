# ProductsDashboard
This repository contains a Power BI dashboard that visualizes product backordered, lost, and returned items using a sample sales dataset. The sales data was imported from an Excel file, then transformed and cleaned in Power Query. The final output is an interactive dashboard that highlights key inventory metrics and trends.
